How to use 5-text_indentation.py
================================

This library is simple because it has only one function
``text_indentation()``

``text_indentation`` returns a new text which is formatted to
print 2 new lines after the characters `. , ? :`

::
    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("This is a boy. That is a girl.")
    This is a boy.
    <BLANKLINE>
    That is a girl.
    <BLANKLINE>

cases caught by the code
::
    >>> text_indentation(62)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text must be a string

cases not caught by the code
::
    >>> text_indentation()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text_indentation() missing 1 required positional argument: 'text'

    >>> text_indentation("That is a boy.", "This is a girl")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text_indentation() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
